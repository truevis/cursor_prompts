Create a `requirements.txt` file for this Streamlit app that will be deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. Include the following instructions:

1. List only the external libraries required for this app to function.
2. Specify the latest stable version for each library using the `==` operator.
3. Do not include Streamlit itself, as it's provided by the Streamlit Cloud environment.
5. Add any other libraries necessary for the app's specific functionality.
6. Place each library on a separate line.
7. Ensure the file is named exactly "requirements.txt" (all lowercase).

Example format for each line:
library_name==X.Y.Z
